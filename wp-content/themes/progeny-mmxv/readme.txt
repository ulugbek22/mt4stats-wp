== Features ==

=== Discography ===

Upload cover images and assign titles and tracks. Everything you need to build your Discography, from entering purchase links for your music to adding lyrics for your tracks, is now at your fingertips.

=== Gigs and Venues ===

Schedule all the details about your next show, including location (address, city, state), dates, times, ticket prices and links to ticket purchasing. Set up your venue information by creating new venues and assigning shows to venues you’ve already created. You also have the ability to feature each venue’s website, along with an address and phone number.

=== Video Library ===

Showcasing your videos doesn’t need to be a hassle. Progeny MMXV allows you to create your video library by simply embedding videos from a number of video services such as YouTube, Vimeo, WordPress.tv, and many more. A Video archive showcases your videos by displaying a featured image linking to the single video page.
